												<p>You can really write whatever you want, the only goal is to have something written there.</p>

												<p>A dialogue will now open and ask you where to save it, just choose a place and rename your file to what you want and end it by .html</p>
												<p>Look at the picture below where we called our page as first.html:</p>

												<p>Well actually to write a web page we can't just type text as we did. More to this text we also need to write what we call tags, those ones will give some instructions to the computer like "go to the next line" or "add an image"</p>

						            </div>

						                <div class="panel-body">
											<p>So this would be too easy, of course some engineer had to come along and complicate everything. It's not enough to just write text in the editor you also need to give instructions to the computer and this is why we have tags.</p>
											<p>HTML pages are full of what we call tags, they are invisible on the screen for your visitors but they allow to the computer what he needs to show.</p>
											<p>Those tags can be spotted easily. They are surrounded with chevron, which means <strong>&lt;</strong> and<strong> &gt;</strong> like the following: <strong>&lt;tag&gt;</strong></p>
											<div class="alert alert-info">
				                                <i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i> <i> What are there purpose exactly ?</i>
				                            </div>
											<p>They indicate the nature of the text they surround. They mean for instance "this is a title" "this is an image" etc</p>
											<p>We distinguish two kinds&nbsp; of tags the paired ones and the orphan one</p>
											<ul>
												<li>
													<h4><strong>The paired tags</strong></h4>
													<p>They open contain texts and are closed later on, here is an example:<br/>
													&lt;title&gt;This is a text&lt;/title&gt;<br />
													We distinguish the opening tag &lt;title&gt; and the closing one &lt;/title&gt; that indicates that the title is finished, this tells the computer that everything that is not in this tage is not a title
													Exemple: this is not a title &lt;title&gt;this is a title&lt;/title&gt; this is not a title</p>
												</li>
												<li>
													<h4><strong>The orphan tags</strong></h4>
													<p>Those are the tags that serve usually to add an element at a specific place like an image. <br/>
													It is not necessary to state the begining and end of an image we will just say to the computer that we want an image here<br/>
													We use an orphan tag as follow:<br/>
													&lt;image /&gt;</p>
													<div class="alert alert-warning">
						                                <i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle"></i> <i> Note that the last / is not mandatory but it is used to not misunderstand this tag to a paired tag, it's let say a convention among web developers</i>
						                            </div>
												</li>
											</ul>
											
											<h3><strong>The attributes</strong></h3>
											<p>The attributes are like options for a tag, they come to complete them and to give more informations to the computer, the attribute comes after the tag name and usually has a value: &lt;tag attribute="value"...</p>
											<div class="alert alert-info">
				                                <i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i> <i> What is it used for ?</i>
				                            </div>
											<p>Let's take our tag &lt;image/&gt; that we just saw, by itself it's not useful but we could add an attribute<br/>
											that would indicate the name of the image to show: &lt;image name="picture.jpg"/&gt;<br/>
											The computer then understands that he needs to show the image that is located in the file picture.jpg<br/>
											In the case of a paired tag the attributes needs to be placed in the opening tag</p>
											<div class="alert alert-info">
				                                <i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i> <i> <strong>Important some of the tags we have seen are fakes for you just to understand the concepts we will see the real ones right now !</strong></i>
				                            </div>
						                </div>
						            </div>
						        </div>
						        <div class="panel panel-default">
						            <div class="panel-heading">
						                <h4 class="panel-title">
						                    <a data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#collapseThree">The structure of an HTML5 page</a>
						                </h4>
						            </div>
						            <div id="collapseThree" class="panel-collapse collapse">
						                <div class="panel-body">
						                	<h3><strong>Structure of an html5 page</strong></h3>
											<p>Let's go back to our notepad and please type in there the same thing as there is on the picture below, which correspond to the basics of any HTML page:</p>
					                        <img alt="browsers" src="images/chapter2img6.png">
											<p>There is some spaces at the begining of the lines to shift away some tags, this is not mandatory and won't change your page at the end but it makes the code easier to read, we call this indenting a page so you just need to press tab to do so in your text editor</p>
											<p>You can see that the tags are opened and closed in a specific order.</p>
											<p>For instance the &lt;html&gt; tag is the first to be opened and the last one to be closed (at the very end of the code with &lt;/html&gt;). <br/>
											The tags must be closed on the oposite way of there opening for instance:</p>
											<ul>
												<li><strong>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;</strong> : this is correct a tag that is opened on the inside must be closed on the inside</li>
												<li><strong>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&lt;/body&gt;</strong>: this is incorrect the tags are one on top of the other</li>
											</ul>
											<div class="alert alert-info">
				                                <i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i> <i> Can we have some details about the tags we have in our page ?</i>
				                            </div>
											<p>Of course let's explain the diferent ones</p>
											<ul>
												<li>
													<h4><strong>The Doctype</strong></h4>
													<p>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</p>
													<p>The first line is called the doctype.</p>
													<p>It is mandatory because that's the one that indicates that we are here creating an html page</p>
													<p>This is not really a tag like the others (it starts with an exclamation mark).</p>
													<p>We can say that its an exception that confirms a rule ;)</p>
												</li>
												<li>
													<h4><strong>The &lt;HTML&gt; tag</strong></h4>
													<p>This is the main tag of the code, it frames up the whole code as you can see the closing tag is at the very end&nbsp; of the code</p>
												</li>
												<li>
													<h4><strong>The &lt;head&gt; and &lt;body&gt; tags</strong></h4>
													<p>A web page is composed of two parts:</p>
													<ul>
														<li>
															<strong>The &lt;head&gt;</strong> : this section gives you some general information on the page like its title, the coding used for special characters etc&hellip; This section is generally short. The info it contains are directed to the computer but nontheless they are very important
														</li>
														<li>
															<strong>The &lt;body&gt;</strong> : that's where is the main part of our page. Everything that we will write here will be displayed on screen. Inside of the body we will write the major part of the code.
														</li>
														
													</ul>
													<p>For now the body is empty (we will see that later). Let's focus on the two other tags in the head.</p>
												</li>
												<li>
													<h4><strong>The encoding (charset)</strong></h4>
													<p>&lt;meta charset="utf-8" /&gt;</p>
													<p>This tag indicates the kind of encoding used in your .html file</p>
													<p>Not going into much details here because it could get complicated really fast. The encoding indicates the way that the file is saved. It determines how the special characters will be displayed (accents, chinese symbols&hellip;)</p>
													<p>Even though there is a lot of diferent encoding we can use nowadays most of the developers use utf-8 it can display almost all possible characters and that's why we will use it here</p>
												</li>
												<li>
													<h4><strong>The title of the page</strong></h4>
													<p>&lt;title&gt;</p>
													<p>This is the title of your page, maybe the most important element!</p>
													<p>Every page must have a title that describes what it contains, it's advised to use short titles less then a 100 characters</p>
													<p>The title won't be displayed on the page itself but on the tab as described in the picture below</p>
							                        <img class="thumbnail" alt="browsers" src="images/chapter2img7.png">
												</li>
												
											</ul>
											<div class="alert alert-warning">
				                                <i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle"></i> <i> Remember that the title will also appear in the results of search engines like google so choosing a good title is very important</i>
				                            </div>
										</div>
						            </div>
						        </div>
						        <div class="panel panel-default">

						            <div id="collapseFour" class="panel-collapse collapse">
						                <div class="panel-body">
							                <h3><strong>Comments</strong></h3>
											<p>We learnt how to create our first real html page in that chapter.</p>
											<p>Before we finish i would like to present you the concept of the comments</p>
											<p>A comment in html is a text that is used as a note or a remainder.</p>
											<p>It is not displayed, it's not read by the computer it doesn't change anything to the page display</p>
											<div class="alert alert-info">
				                                <i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i> <i> So it's not used for anything ?</i>
				                            </div>
											<p><strong>Of course it is !</strong></p>
											<p>It is useful to you and to the persons that will read the source code of your page.</p>
											<p>You can leave some comments to have some indications on how your page works</p>
											<div class="alert alert-info">
				                                <i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i> <i> What's the point ?</i>
				                            </div>
											<p>It will help you remember how your page is working if you come back to your code after a long time. Don't laugh it happens to every webmaster.</p>
											<h4><strong>Inserting a comment</strong></h4>
											<p>A comment is a special html tag:</p>
											<p>&lt;!-- this is a comment --&gt;</p>
											<p>You can put it anywhere you want in your code there is no impact in the way the page is displayed but you can use it for instance to remember where you are in your code especially if it is a long code !</p>
					                        <img class="thumbnail" alt="browsers" src="images/chapter2img8.png">
					                        <img class="thumbnail" alt="browsers" src="images/chapter2img9.png">
											<p>You can easily test this see this in every webpage because the browser has to dispaly the html every html page is public.</p>
											<p>End of the story, everybody can see your html code and there is nothing you can do to stop them, so don't put there important information like passwords in comments ;)</p>
											<p>So create a clean code easy to understand ! For you and others !</p>
						                </div>
						            </div>

											<p>So now we have a white page its very nice but not very useful so here we will discover some of the basic tags that every developer needs to know</p>
											<ul>
												<li>
													<h4>The paragraph tag !</h4>
													<p>Most of the time when we write texts on a webpage we do it in paragraphs so in html a tag was created with this purpose specifically and it is &lt;p&gt;</p>
													<p>&lt;p&gt; hi welcome on my website&lt;/p&gt;</p>
													<p>&lt;p&gt; signifies the begining of the paragraph and &lt;/p&gt; the end of it</p>
													<p>As said previously we need to add this tag inside our tag &lt;body&gt; so it will be displayed your page should look like this:</p>
							                        <img class="thumbnail" alt="browsers" src="images/chapter2img10.png">
													<p>It's important to notice that we can' go to a new line just pressing enter to do so we need to use a special tag &lt;br /&gt; this explains to the brower that the text must start on a newline now.</p>
													<p>The &lt;br/&gt; tag is an orphan tag and can be placed inside paragraphs</p>
													<p>Now let's see another tag:</p>
												</li>
												<li>
													<h4>The title tag !</h4>
													<p>As anywhere we use titles and titles can have diferent importance for instance in a book the title of the book won't be the same as the title of the chapters, to achieve this in html we defined six diferent levels of importance:</p>
													<p>&lt;h1&gt;the bigger title&lt;/h1&gt; &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.. &lt;h6&gt;title really REALLY not important at all&lt;/h6&gt;</p>
													<p>In practice those six levels are rarely used we most importantly use &lt;h1&gt; &lt;h2&gt; &lt;h3&gt; those are generally enough :)</p>
													<p>You can try it out on a page like the one below</p>
							                        <img class="thumbnail" alt="browsers" src="images/chapter2img11.png">
													<p>That's a page that is starting to look like stomething !!</p>
												</li>

											<div class="alert alert-info">

							                <p>Let's sum up what we have seen so far:</p>
											<ul>
											    <li>We use notepad to create a file that ends up in .html that will be our webpage</li>
											    <li>This file can easily be opened by any browser just clicking on it</li>
											    <li>In this file we will write the content of our page using html tags</li>
											    <li>The tags can have different types:</li>
											    <li>&lt;tag&gt; &lt;/tag&gt; : they open and close to frame a content (begining and end)</li>
											    <li>&lt;tag /&gt; orphan tags (they don't have closing tag) and they are used to add something at a very specific place like an image</li>
											    <li>The tags can have attributes &lt;image name="picture.jpg"&gt;</li>
											    <li>A webpage is composed of two sections &lt;head&gt; and &lt;body&gt;</li>
											    <li>We can see the source code of every webpage online.</li>
											    <li>We saw the very basic tags needed like &lt;hX&gt; the title tag where X goes from 1 to 6 and the paragraph tag &lt;p&gt;
											</ul>
